== sangeet ==

Sangeet, or Music, is the elegant art which allows us to express ourselves via rhythm and harmony. It is the amalgamation of singing, playing instruments and gesticulating or gesturing.

In Indian classical music, there are two major systems of music - Uttari or Hindustani, prevailing in the northern parts of India, and Dakshini or Carnatic, prevailing in the south.

As in every art form, there are two sides to sangeet - theory and practice.

== dhvani ==

Everything we hear is dhvani, or a sound note, be it a vocalist singing, the wails of a crying baby on an airplane or the random hostel-wide screaming contests that keep happening periodically. Some dhvanis are peaceful to hear, which sangeet deals with. Those sweet notes are called Naad.

== aandolan ==

When you pluck the stretched strings of a Sarod, Sitar or a Tanpura, the to and fro, back and forth motion of the strings is called Aandolan or Kampan, or simply vibrations. It is because of these aandolans that dhvani is generated.

== naad ==

Sweet dhvanis created by proper, stable vibrations are called Naad. In other words, dhvanis that are fit to be used in sangeet are called Naad. There are three characteristics of Naad:
Loudness and softness
Index position
Group and quality

== saptak ==
Sequence of the 7 shuddh svaras. Agitation level increases as we progress along the sequence.
For example, agitation of Pancham is 3/2 times that of Shadaj. So if we consider Sa to be at 440 Hz, Pa would be at 660 Hz.
After Ni, Shadaj of the next octave is encountered.
Mandra, madhya, taar

== thaat ==
